# EditDistance
In computational linguistics and computer science, edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

This repository aims to not only implement the code but make the user understand the concept of Edit Dstance with the help of GUI implementation.

This GUI is built by javaFX
